{{< youtube id="aFKo0GPwDDI" >}}<br>Polarity discusses the uses of the all-pass filter in `Poly Grid` .  You can get some effects like:<br>
<br>
1. Delay<br>2. Distortion<br>3. Comb Filtering<br><br>
He also demonstrates how you can construct reverbs using many all pass filters in series (which some other stuff too).  He references this technical blog:<br>
